First repository of my membership
I always talk with people about the value of ducomenting your own life. My own experiences sometimes feel just as boring as anyone else's or just as interesting. It is a matter of choice. I hope to reach a balance where my description allows my audience to engage naturally and find their own level of interest in my story. 
I am a product designer with a certificate in urban design I got following a few years of doing landscape design. My interest in coding started as an observer of other people's work. I hope to find a way to integrate the coding skill into my toolset. Currently I am dealing with finding opportunities to contribute to urban development. 
I live in Vancouver, BC; am married to a scientist researching stem cell technology; we are following our grade seven daughter's progress in life and school.
